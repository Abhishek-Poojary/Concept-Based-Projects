# Typing Speed Tester

A simple web application that helps users measure their typing speed and accuracy in real time.

## Features

* Displays a random text for typing practice
* Calculates typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)
* Tracks typing accuracy
* Real time feedback as the user types
* Timer based test session
* Responsive and lightweight UI

## Tech Stack

* React
* Vite
* Typescript
* CSS

## How It Works

1. The app presents a predefined or randomly generated text.
2. The user starts typing and the timer begins automatically.
3. WPM is calculated based on correctly typed characters.
4. Accuracy is calculated by comparing user input with the reference text.
5. Results are shown once the timer ends or the test is completed.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local server URL shown in the terminal to view the app in the browser.

## Future Improvements

* Multiple difficulty levels
* Custom time limits
* Dark mode
* Keyboard heatmap and error highlights
* Result history and progress tracking
